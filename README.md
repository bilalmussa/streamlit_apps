# streamlit_customer_data
This folder contains a streamlit app that takes customer and sales data using only 4 fields and provides insight into the customer behaviour.
It doesnt store any data.

Packages used: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn

App: https://share.streamlit.io/bilalmussa/streamlit_customer_data/main/customer_data_app.py

Would be great to get feedback regarding the app. I can be reached via LinkedIn or bilalmussa@gmail.com
